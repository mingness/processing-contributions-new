  sentence: Assists creation of data visualization sketches.
  paragraph: Includes color utilities, statistical graphics, morphing classes, spatial
    utilities and map projections, force-directed layouts and text input/output. Together
    these make the task of creating data visualization sketches much faster by providing
    code for commonly repeated tasks such as zooming in and out of a sketch, setting
    up color tables etc. For documentation and examples, see the [gicentreUtils pages](http://www.gicentre.org/utils/).

    code shows the output incrementally, much like how an REPL Console for any interpretive
    language (like Python, and the Linux bash terminal) would. The console also provides
    options to undo commands, to convert the valid commands entered so far into a
    function, and so on. Ths mode also gives the PDE the ability to hot swap code,
    wherein the output corresponding to changes made in a running sketch can be viewed
    by simply saving the sketch, without restarting it.

  sentence: Calculation of mouse coordinates in transformed 2D animation matrices.
  paragraph: Processing's reserved keywords "mouseX" & "mouseY" store the mouse coordinates
    with respect to the upper left corner of the sketch. When no transformations (i.e.
    translate(), scale(), rotate(), pushMatrix(), popMatrix()) are applied, these
    coordinates refer to the actual position in the animation matrix. However, when
    transformations are applied, this relation no longer holds. With this library,
    one can get the actual position of the mouse in both transformed and non transformed
    animation matrices.

  sentence: Perceptually-accurate and human-friendly color picking using the Oklab
    color space.
  paragraph: This library includes a small collection of functions to help you pick
    colors with perceptual accuracy using Bjorn Ottosson's Oklab color space. This
    works in contrast to generating colors using RGB or HSB values, in which similar
    difference in input values don't represent similar difference in color output.

    for swing in general
  paragraph: Adding swing components to processing is hard this library makes this
    process easier by adding a few classes and annotations that allow to merge a processing
    content with swing components. The library adds 3 classes to do that in various
    ways and allow including custom ways with just a few lines of code. The library
    also includes utility to format buttons by e.g. edit their color or strap methods
    onto them along with a few other QOL functions.

  sentence: A class and collection of utilities for complex numbers.
  paragraph: A complex number is a linear combination of 1 and i (the square root
    of -1), such as 2+3i, 8+7i, -1-i, 2-2.8i, or -1.863+4.211i.  The term with the
    i is called the imaginary part, while the term without the i is called the real
    part.  Complex numbers allow for many things that wouldn't otherwise be possible
    using only real numbers (numbers without an imaginary part).  By allowing you
    to square root negative numbers, complex numbers open up a whole new world of
    possibilities, while still conserving most fundamental math rules we've come to
    accept with real numbers.
